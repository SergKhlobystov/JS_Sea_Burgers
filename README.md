# 🍔 JS Sea Burgers - Food Ordering App

A small vanilla JavaScript project that simulates an online café ordering flow.

The goal of this project was not visual polish or feature overload, but **understanding state, events, and DOM manipulation without frameworks**.

- Basic UX flow without page reloads

No frameworks. No libraries.  
Just **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Why this project exists

This project was built as part of a learning path before moving on to:

- Responsive design
- Component-based thinking
- React

The focus here was **clarity over cleverness** and **understanding over shortcuts**.

## 🛠️ Possible Improvements (intentionally skipped)

- Animations
- Form validation
- Accessibility polish
- Local storage
- Advanced UI effects

These were deliberately left out to keep the learning scope clean.
